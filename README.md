# AI-Powered Stock Screener Tool

## Overview
This Python script (`screener_stocks.ipynb`) fetches stock data from Finviz, filters high-potential tickers (e.g., ATR% > 3.0), and generates an HTML chart gallery with 40+ stocks (e.g., AMD, NET) for visual review. It drives my investment watchlist strategy, contributing to 121% equity gains since 2020 (accelerated in 2024). As a software engineer with 19 years of experience (5 as Amazon SDM) and AI/ML post graduation from UT Austin McCombs, Iâ€™m open to fintech consulting, where this tool supports trading and portfolio optimization.

## Features
- Aggregates Finviz screeners (10% Change, Growth, IPO, etc.).
- Fetches metrics (ATR%, EPS, Sales Y/Y TTM).
- Outputs CSV and HTML chart gallery (see below).

3. Applies custom filters and outputs to CSV/HTML.
4. Creates a visual chart gallery.
